liblarch (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed completely the "transparency" property
  * Added a new object : viewcount
  * The version number of liblarch will now be the API number + a number. Meaning that:
    0.0.1 releases are pure bugfix/performance releases without impact on your application
    0.1.0 releases introduce new API but are backward compatible. You don't need to port your application.
    1.0.0 releases break the API.
