2012-11-08 liblarch 2.1.1
* Introducing the changelog
* Removed completely the "transparency" property
* Added a new object :Â viewcount
* The version number of liblarch will now be the API number + a number. Meaning that:
  0.0.1 releases are pure bugfix/performance releases without impact on your application
  0.1.0 releases introduce new API but are backward compatible. You don't need to port your application.
  1.0.0 releases break the API.
