Liblarch

If you find Gtk.Treeview and Gtk.Treemodel hard to use, then liblarch is probably for you.

Liblarch is a python library built to easily handle data structure such are lists, trees and acyclic graphs
(tree where nodes can have multiple parents). There's also a liblarch-gtk binding that will allow you to use
your data structure into a Gtk.Treeview.

Liblarch support multiple views of one data structure and complex filtering. That way, you have a clear
separation between your data themselves (Model) and how they are displayed (View).
